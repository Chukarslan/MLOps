YOLOv6 Damage Classification System
Introduction

This project aims to classify images into "damage" or "non-damage" categories using transfer learning from a pre-trained YOLOv6 model. The system was created with a React frontend and a Python backend, and includes a trainModel function to fine-tune the YOLOv6 model with new data.
Key Features

    Accept user upload of images
    Classify images into "damage" or "non-damage" categories
    Ability for the user to train the model with new data by uploading an image and specifying its label
    Store user-corrected predictions and corresponding images in a database
    Option to retrain the model using the corrected data

Innovations

    The system was created using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, ChatGPT.
    The use of YOLOv6 for image classification, one of the most accurate and fast object detection models.

Limitations

    The model's accuracy depends on the quality and quantity of the training data.
    The trainModel function only accepts one image at a time, limiting the speed of fine-tuning the model.

Conclusion

This YOLOv6 Damage Classification System provides a user-friendly interface for image classification with the ability to fine-tune the model with new data. While there are limitations, it offers a starting point for further development and improvement.
